# Lightweight Emulator Icons
This was an icon set that I found 5 years ago on reddit, as things tend to do on the internet this disappeared.  I am reposting here as I found a zip file of the art on one of my old devices.

I have attempted to reach out to the owner but was unable to find anyone to attribute this art to.  I am simply posting to give others access, this was created by an internet anon.
